-There is no working version of the entire SHRDLU program because
there is no working implementation of MICROPLANNER. Contributions
of same gladly accepted.

-There is, however, a working version of the PROGRAMMAR parser and
grammar that Terry and I developed. It lives as SHRDL1;TS PARSER
and is relatively self-explanitory when started from DDT.

-This directory contains the expr code for the entire SHRDLU system
plus what documentation was ever written and a cross-INDEX'ing.
Requests are often made for the system by people at other instalations
and i send them the contents of this directory
