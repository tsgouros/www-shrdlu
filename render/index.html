	<p>Welcome to www.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHRDLU" target="_blank">SHRDLU</a> -- Beta testing.</p>
      </div>
      <p>
	SHRDLU is a landmark AI program written by Terry Winograd at
	MIT, 1968-1971.  Though the symbolic approach to language
	understanding has fallen out of favor since then, few projects
	since have achieved anything like the language facility of
	SHRDLU.</p>
      <p>
	Originally written for MACLISP, a long-dead dialect of Lisp,
	for MIT's Incompatible Time Sharing system (ITS), a long-dead
	operating system, it was ported to Common Lisp
	(<a href="http://www.clisp.org" target="_blank">CLisp</a> to be precise) in
	the 1990s
	by <a href="http://www.semaphorecorp.com/misc/shrdlu.html" target="_blank">a
	group of students</a> in Missouri.  Tom Sgouros, 
	at Brown University, has fixed a few bugs from that port, written a
	web-compatible graphics front end, and equipped SHRDLU with
	new digs here on the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
	Close this window and click the "S" icon below left to get started.
	Type your commands in the form of English sentences, and end
	them with a period, question mark or exclamation point.  In
	the process of being ported twice, SHRDLU has lost some of its
	original functionality.  Think of this version as SHRDLU that
	has suffered a minor stroke.  Despite that limitation, SHRDLU
	can still accommodate requests like "find a block smaller than
	the one you are holding and put it in the box."  But don't
	take my word for it; give it a try.
      </p>
      <p>
	If you would like to check out, fix, or otherwise contribute
	to the code, you'll find a git repo for it at
	<a href="http://github.com/tsgouros/www-shrdlu" target="_blank">github</a>.</p>
      <p>
	<b>Getting started.</b>  SHRDLU's language is deep but not
	extensive, and the error recovery is not great, either.  Try a
	dialog like the following to see what it can do:</p>
      <p class="shrdlu-sentence">
	Put the biggest green block in the box.</p>
      <p class="shrdlu-response">
	Ok.</p>
      <p class="shrdlu-sentence">
        Put the blue block on it.</p>
      <p class="shrdlu-response">
        Ok.</p>
      <p class="shrdlu-sentence">
	Is there a red block under a green one?</p>
      <p class="shrdlu-response">
        Yes, two of them the large red one and the red cube.</p>
      <p class="shrdlu-sentence">
        Put the blue block on the large red block.</p>
      <p class="shrdlu-response">
        Ok.</p>
      <p class="shrdlu-sentence">
        Put the large red block on the red cube.</p>
      <p class="shrdlu-response">Ok.</p>
      <p class="shrdlu-sentence">
        Is there a block smaller than the blue pyramid?</p>
      <p class="shrdlu-response">
	Yes, the red cube.</p>
      <p class="shrdlu-sentence">
        Does it support a block?</p>
      <p class="shrdlu-response">
	Yes, the large red one.</p>

	<p>Welcome to 
	  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHRDLU" target="_blank">SHRDLU</a>.  Try entering sentences such as "put the
	red cube in the box." or "Is there a cube?"  End all sentences
	with a period, exclamation point, or question mark.
	Remember, there is nothing but the table.</p>
